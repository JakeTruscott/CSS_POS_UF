# Course Overview

### Computational Social Science

-   Computational Social Science is an incredibly broad sub-field within scope of political science. Particularly useful for concepts including (but not limited to):
    \par \vspace{2.5mm}
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Text as Data}: Analyses of legislative speeches, party platforms, and court opinions to measure ideology, framing, and rhetorical strategies.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Social Media \& Online Behavior}: Mined to study political communication, polarization, misinformation, and mobilization.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Networks \& Relationships}: Mapping legislative coalitions, donor connections, and influence in lobbying or policymaking.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Simulation \& Modeling}: Agent-based and computational models simulate collective action, polarization, and institutional processes.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Elections \& Campaigns}: Modeling to help forecast elections.

### Computational Social Science (Cont.)

-   We don't have time to cover every layer of methodology or substantive concept (\emph{nor would I feel qualified}...)
-   Instead, we are largely going to focus on two goals for this semester: \par \vspace{2.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Improve your proficiency and competency with programming in \texttt{R} and (to a lesser extent) \texttt{Python} \par \vspace{2.5mm}
\item Introduce methodologies primarily in the realm of \texttt{Text as Data} – with an eye towards both conceptual knowledge and application.
\end{enumerate}


### Computational Social Science (Cont.)
- By the end of the semester, you should be able to: \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  - Conduct advanced computing routines, including multi-layered and hierarchical coding structures \footnotesize (e.g., iterative loops, data organization and manipulation, functions, package construction, etc.) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Retrieve, process, and organize non-traditional data sources (e.g., text) for classification tasks using a combination of natural language processes (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning
models) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Create informative representations of data and other summary findings (e.g., tables and figures) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Produce replicable coding routines using compilation suites in R, Python, and LaTex(Beamer) \par \vspace{1.5mm}

### Materials and Evaluation -- Grading & Evaluation

Weekly Problem Sets    \dotfill 40\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 
Participation \dotfill 10\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 
Final Project \& Presentation \dotfill 50\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 




### Materials and Evaluation -- Evaluation (Problem Sets)

- Problem sets due to Canvas on Sundays by 11:59pm \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- I will drop the two submissions with lowest marks \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- Must be compiled using \texttt{RMarkdown} -- We will discuss file organization today \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- We will spend the first 30min-1hr of each class period reviewing the problem set from the week before. 


### Materials and Evaluation -- Expectations 

Expectations are fairly simple: \par \vspace{5mm}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Come to Class Prepared \& Ready to Learn  \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help  \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Embrace the Learning Curve


\end{enumerate}


### Materials and Evaluation -- Other Notes

- The course is technology driven -- You need to come prepared with a laptop capable of downloading \texttt{R}, \texttt{RStudio}, and \texttt{Python} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- I am maintaining a GitHub Repository and website for the course: \url{https://jaketruscott.github.io/CSS_POS_UF/} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- The website has many additional resources for each week of the semester.

# Downloading \texttt{R} & \texttt{Python}

### Downloading \texttt{R} \hspace{1.5mm} \includegraphics[width=5mm]{../../images/R_logo.png}

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item \texttt{R} is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and data analysis. \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \item It is designed specifically for working with data, running statistical tests, creating models, and visualizing results. \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \item \textbf{Why \texttt{R} and not \texttt{Stata} or \texttt{Python}} (exclusively)? \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{R} is incredibly flexible, intuitive, easily accessible, and free! 
  \end{itemize}
  
  \end{itemize}





### Downloading \texttt{R} (Cont.) \hspace{1.5mm} \includegraphics[width=5mm]{../../images/R_logo.png}

- We will use \texttt{R} for just about everything in this course. \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- Even when we shift to tools better suited for \texttt{Python}, I will show you how can implement through \texttt{R} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- To download \texttt{R} and its companion IDE \texttt{RStudio}, visit: \url{https://jaketruscott.github.io/CSS_POS_UF/class_1/downloading_R.html} \par \vspace{2.5mm}


















### Downloading \texttt{Python} \hspace{1.5mm} \includegraphics[width=5mm]{../../images/Python_logo.png}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item \texttt{Python} is a versatile, general-purpose programming language – it can be used for web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and more. \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \item Many of you may already have exposure to \texttt{Python} from Dr. Arfi's classes -- You are welcome to use more \texttt{Python} if you so choose, though I will be teaching \texttt{R} primarily.  \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \item To download \texttt{R} and its companion IDE \texttt{RStudio}, visit: \url{https://jaketruscott.github.io/CSS_POS_UF/class_1/downloading_Python.html} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

  
  \end{itemize}




















# Data Storage and Organization

### Data Storage and Organization

- It is imperative that you put yourself in the best position to succeed. \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- Part of that entails a system for organizing your data and \texttt{R}/\texttt{Python} scripts. \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- I am going to require everything you complete for this course -- both during our classroom meetings and as homework -- be completed using \texttt{RMarkdown}. 


### Data Storage and Organization (Cont.)

\begin{itemize}

\item We are going to create a directory (folder) to house all of your data, code, and other materials. \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item \texttt{R} is able to create localized project directories and provides the ability to load or export from a relative path -- i.e., you do \underline{not} need to include the full path to a file.  \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Ex: Assuming \texttt{R} Project is Located in \footnotesize{\textbf{"C:/Users/JakeTruscott/Folder"}}

\end{itemize}

\footnotesize
```{r path_example, echo=TRUE, eval=F, tidy=T}

load('C:/Users/JakeTruscott/Folder/SubFolder/File.rdata') 
# Full Path

load('SubFolder/File.rdata') 
# Relative Path

```




### Data Storage and Organization (Cont.)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Create a new folder -- somewhere obvious and unlikely to be accidentally deleted. \par \vspace{1.5mm}

\item Open \texttt{RStudio} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Navigate to \texttt{File} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{New Project...} \par \vspace{1.5mm}

\item Select \texttt{Existing Directory} \par \vspace{1.5mm}

\item Navigate to and Select the folder you created in Step 1 \par \vspace{1.5mm}

\item Check \texttt{Open in New Session} and Select \texttt{Open} \par \vspace{1.5mm}

\end{enumerate}
