## Topic Models

Recall that one of our first exercises using text as data was to analyze State of the Union addresses by former presidents -- particularly as it relates to concepts like the military and the economy. To do this, we made at least two important assumptions: 

1. Presidents may touch on various policy areas and themes throughout these speeches. 

2. Even though they may draw from different perspectives and contexts, we can define a word or assert a general vocabulary to identify those thematic elements -- e.g., I can use terms like *navy*, *army*, *marines*, etc. to reasonably identify periods where the president is discussing military matters. 

If we were to apply a clustering algorithm to these speeches, we may be incidentally obscuring our ability to correctly identify these various discussion points. Even clustering algorithms that use *soft partitioning* are likely to draw documents towards a single cluster center. But when we have documents where themes and other distinct literary elements are in flux throughout, we may want to instead rely on topic models. 

**Topic Models** are similar to clustering methods with an important caveat: *rather than assign each document to only one cluster, topic models assign each document with proportional membership to all categories (topics). That is, topic models suppose that each document is a mixture across categories -- a mixed membership model* (GSR Ch. 13). The key benefit here is that we don't need a single topic to be representative an entire document on its own. For instance, in trying to identify how presidents may discuss the economy, topic models may help us understand this through the lens of more discrete items like the welfare state, taxation, foreign trade or other topics within the broader scope of discussion related to economic policy -- we don't need to say that only one of these should be used to discuss a speech (like a SOTU address) that touches on all of them!
