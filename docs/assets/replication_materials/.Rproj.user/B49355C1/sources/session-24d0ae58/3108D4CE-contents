# Course Overview

### Computational Social Science

-   Computational Social Science is an incredibly broad sub-field within scope of political science. Particularly useful for concepts including (but not limited to):
    \par \vspace{2.5mm}
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Text as Data}: Analyses of legislative speeches, party platforms, and court opinions to measure ideology, framing, and rhetorical strategies.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Social Media \& Online Behavior}: Mined to study political communication, polarization, misinformation, and mobilization.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Networks \& Relationships}: Mapping legislative coalitions, donor connections, and influence in lobbying or policymaking.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Simulation \& Modeling}: Agent-based and computational models simulate collective action, polarization, and institutional processes.
    -   \footnotesize \textbf{Elections \& Campaigns}: Modeling to help forecast elections.

### Computational Social Science (Cont.)

-   We don't have time to cover every layer of methodology or substantive concept (\emph{nor would I feel qualified}...)
-   Instead, we are largely going to focus on two goals for this semester: \par \vspace{2.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Improve your proficiency and competency with programming in \texttt{R} and (to a lesser extent) \texttt{Python} \par \vspace{2.5mm}
\item Introduce methodologies primarily in the realm of \texttt{Text as Data} – with an eye towards both conceptual knowledge and application.
\end{enumerate}


### Computational Social Science (Cont.)
- By the end of the semester, you should be able to: \par \vspace{2.5mm}
  - Conduct advanced computing routines, including multi-layered and hierarchical coding structures \footnotesize (e.g., iterative loops, data organization and manipulation, functions, package construction, etc.) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Retrieve, process, and organize non-traditional data sources (e.g., text) for classification tasks using a combination of natural language processes (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning
models) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Create informative representations of data and other summary findings (e.g., tables and figures) \par \vspace{1.5mm}
  - Produce replicable coding routines using compilation suites in R, Python, and LaTex(Beamer) \par \vspace{1.5mm}

### Materials and Evaluation -- Grading & Evaluation

Weekly Problem Sets    \dotfill 40\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 
Participation \dotfill 10\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 
Final Project \& Presentation \dotfill 50\% \par \vspace{1.5mm} 




### Materials and Evaluation -- Evaluation (Problem Sets)

- Problem sets due to Canvas on Sundays by 11:59pm \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- I will drop the two submissions with lowest marks \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- Must be compiled using \texttt{RMarkdown} -- We will discuss file organization today \par \vspace{1.5mm}

- We will spend the first 30min-1hr of each class period reviewing the problem set from the week before. 


### Materials and Evaluation -- Expectations 

Expectations are fairly simple: \par \vspace{5mm}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Come to Class Prepared \& Ready to Learn  \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help  \par \vspace{2.5mm}

\item Embrace the Learning Curve


\end{enumerate}


### Materials and Evaluation -- Other Notes

- The course is technology driven -- You need to come prepared with a laptop capable of downloading \texttt{R}, \texttt{RStudio}, and \texttt{Python} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- I am maintaining a GitHub Repository and website for the course: \url{https://jaketruscott.github.io/CSS_POS_UF/} \par \vspace{2.5mm}

- The website has many additional resources for each week of the semester.
