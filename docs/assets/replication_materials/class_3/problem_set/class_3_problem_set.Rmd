<b>Note</b>: Students should always aim to produce <i>publication-worthy</i> tables and figures. Unless otherwise stated, tables should be rendered using <code>stargazer::()</code>, while figures can be rendered using <code>ggplot2::()</code> or <code>plot()</code>. Regardless, tables and figures should always be presented with necessary formatting -- e.g., (sub)title, axis (variable) labels and titles, a clearly-identifiable legend and key, etc. Problem sets must always be compiled using <code>LaTex</code> or <code>RMarkdown</code> and include the full coding routine (with notes explaining your implementation) used to complete each problem (10pts).

1.  Write a function to sample at least 100k draws from a distribution of your choice before performing some secondary task. Afterwards, compare the performance of your task given a serial versus parallel approaches with at least three different sizes of cores being allocated. For this comparison, construct a table using `stargazer(html)` to record the computation strategy, number of cores, completion time, mean value, and 95 percent confidence intervals. (5pts)


2.  Create a function that...
