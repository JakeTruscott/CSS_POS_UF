<code>R</code> is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available through the web page of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</a>. 
<br>
Regardless of your operating system (Windows or Mac OS), you will first need to navigate <a href= "https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/">HERE</a>. This link will redirect you to the CRAN Mirror maintained by Duke University (NC). CRAN Mirrors are servers that hosts CRAN files, allowing you to download <code>R</code> packages and updates from a geographically closer or faster location. While there are many mirrors located in the United States, Duke's is closest in proximity to the University of Florida.

## Downloading <code>R</code> for Windows

<ol>
<li> Select ``Download R for Windows'' </li>
<li> You want to select the <b>base</b> option. This will likely include a notice stating (something along the lines of) <i>This is what you want to install R for the first time</i></li>
<li> The link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows. Run this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. </li>
<li> The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu </li>
</ol>

## Downloading <code>R</code> for MacOS


<ol>
<li> Select ``Download R for macOS'' </li>
<li> Select the link attributed to the most recent version of <code>R</code> and <code>MacOS</code> (as of September 2025,  R 4.5.1) </li>
<li> An installer will download to guide you through the installation process. Although the installer provides for custom settings, it is unlikely this will be necessary </li>
</ol>


## Downloading and Running <code>RStudio</code>

R isn't a program that you can just open and run -- it is a programming language that, when operationalized through an interpreter, is capable of translating your code into instructions that a computer can execute to perform statistical analyses, manipulate data, and create visualizations. 
<br>

When downloading <code>R</code> from <code>CRAN</code>, the program automatically installs RGui -- a graphical user interface. This no-frills version of <code>R</code> is likely a version you have seen being used among researchers (and programmers) who have been around for a bit. 
<br>

Luckily, most researchers today use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called <code>RStudio</code> -- and I recommend you do that, as well. Downloading <code>RStudio</code> is relatively straightforward and generally the same on both Mac and Windows machines. Simply navigate  <a href= "http://www.rstudio.com/ide">HERE</a> and select <b>Download RStudio Desktop for Free</b>. Follow the installation instructions and you should be good to go. 
<br>

<i>Note</i>: <code>RStudio</code> itself does not come with a packaged version of <code>R</code> (nor a copy of its program files) -- you will still need to download a version of <code>R</code>. Otherwise, <code>RStudio</code> should be able to automatically locate the program files with the version of <code>R</code> you just downloaded.
