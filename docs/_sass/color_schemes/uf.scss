// If you want to base it on dark theme, uncomment the import. If you prefer light as base, leave it out.
// @import "./color_schemes/dark";

// Then override variables:
$primary: #0021A5;      // Gator Blue
$secondary: #FA4616;    // UF Orange

// Some useful variables:
$link-color: $primary;
$nav-link-color: $primary;
$body-heading-color: $primary;
$sidebar-color: $primary;
$sidebar-active-color: $secondary;
$site-title-color: $secondary;
// etc â€” you can set as many as you want using variables listed in _variables.scss
